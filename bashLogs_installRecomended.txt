[1m
Welcome to Rust!
(B[m
This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /home/guest/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /home/guest/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The [1mcargo(B[m, [1mrustc(B[m, [1mrustup(B[m and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /home/guest/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your [1mPATH(B[m environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/guest/.profile
  /home/guest/.bashrc

You can uninstall at any time with [1mrustup self uninstall(B[m and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your [1mPATH(B[m environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

  Build and run container images with Docker.
  
  **Usage**
  
  * This build can only access files in the home directory. So Dockerfiles and all
  other files used in commands like `docker build`, `docker save` and `docker
  load` need to be in $HOME.
  * You can change the configuration of this build by modifying the files in
  `/var/snap/docker/current/`.
  * Additional certificates used by the Docker daemon to authenticate with
  registries need to be added in `/var/snap/docker/current/etc/docker/certs.d`
  (instead of `/etc/docker/certs.d`). This directory can be accessed by other
  snaps using the `docker-registry-certificates` content interface.
  
  **Running Docker as normal user**
  
  By default, Docker is only accessible with root privileges (`sudo`). If you want
  to use docker as a regular user, you need to add your user to the `docker`
  group.
  
      sudo addgroup --system docker
      sudo adduser $USER docker
      newgrp docker
      sudo snap disable docker
      sudo snap enable docker
  
  **Warning:** if you add your user to the `docker` group, it will have similar
  power as the `root` user. For details on how this impacts security in your
  system, see
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface

  Build and run container images with Docker.
  
  **Usage**
  
  * This build can only access files in the home directory. So Dockerfiles and all
  other files used in commands like `docker build`, `docker save` and `docker
  load` need to be in $HOME.
  * You can change the configuration of this build by modifying the files in
  `/var/snap/docker/current/`.
  * Additional certificates used by the Docker daemon to authenticate with
  registries need to be added in `/var/snap/docker/current/etc/docker/certs.d`
  (instead of `/etc/docker/certs.d`). This directory can be accessed by other
  snaps using the `docker-registry-certificates` content interface.
  
  **Running Docker as normal user**
  
  By default, Docker is only accessible with root privileges (`sudo`). If you want
  to use docker as a regular user, you need to add your user to the `docker`
  group.
  
      sudo addgroup --system docker
      sudo adduser $USER docker
      newgrp docker
      sudo snap disable docker
      sudo snap enable docker
  
  **Warning:** if you add your user to the `docker` group, it will have similar
  power as the `root` user. For details on how this impacts security in your
  system, see
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface

[?2004lUsage:
  snap refresh [refresh-OPTIONS] [<snap>...]

The refresh command updates the specified snaps, or all snaps in the system if
none are specified.

With no further options, the snaps are refreshed to the current revision of the
channel they're tracking, preserving their confinement options. All available
channels of a snap are listed in its 'snap info' output.

When --revision is used, a later refresh will typically undo the revision
override.

Hold (--hold) is used to postpone snap refresh updates for all snaps when no
snaps are specified, or for the specified snaps.

When no snaps are specified --hold is only effective on auto-refreshes and will
not block either general refresh requests from 'snap refresh' or specific snap
requests from 'snap refresh target-snap'.

and general refresh requests from 'snap refresh'. However, specific snap
requests from 'snap refresh target-snap' remain unblocked and will proceed.

Welcome to Rust!
(B[m
This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /home/guest/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /home/guest/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The [1mcargo(B[m, [1mrustc(B[m, [1mrustup(B[m and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /home/guest/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your [1mPATH(B[m environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/guest/.profile
  /home/guest/.bashrc

You can uninstall at any time with [1mrustup self uninstall(B[m and
these changes will be reverted.

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your [1mPATH(B[m environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
