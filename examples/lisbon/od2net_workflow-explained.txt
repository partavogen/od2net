################################################## od2net inputs ##################################################
(MANDATORY) At least two inputs are needed to run od2net: setup.py and config.json. 

		1. config.json        -
		2. setup.py           - 
	
(OPTIONAL) The user can further parametrize simulation runs by creating standalone files called by the config.json 
           upon runs. The code within these files can be embedded in the mandatory files but it's probably wiser 
           to separate them for easier alternate run preparation and handling. 
	
		3. cost_customization - Cost function customization (added granularity vs config.json options and
								     corresponding default values)
		4.                    -
		5. etc...

### config options (check repo @ od2net/od2net/src/config.rs) 

pattern:

	 1. "FromEveryOriginToOneDestination"      - Simulates trips between every origin and the the first destination only (destination_path). 
	 					   ^ USED IN 
 	 					   ~ e.g.: "FromEveryOriginToOneDestination"
	 					   
[bcR-p]  2. "FromEveryOriginToNearestDestination" - Simulates trips between every origin and the nearest destination (as the crow flies)
 	   					   ^ USED IN LONDON EXAMPLE
 	   					   # COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
 	   					     RUN SIMULATIONS
 	 					   ~ e.g.: "From EveryOriginToNearestDestination"
 	 					   
[bcR-p]	 3. "BetweenZones"                         - Simulates trips between two zones according to a given O/D matrix (.csv format)
						     The O/D matrix must contain 3 columns: "from" denoting the name of given origin area, 
						     "to" denoting name of given destination area and "count" denoting number of trips with
						     of that O/D pair.
						   ^ USED IN EDINBURGH, ENGLAND_2011 EXAMPLES
						   ~ e.g.: { 
						   	     BetweenZones { zones_path: path to geojson w/polygons and multipolygons 
						   					with a "name" property,
						   			    csv_path: path to .csv with O/D matrix as "from", "to" and "count"
						   			  } 
			   			  	   }
						   			  
[bcR-p]  4. "ZoneToPoint"                          - Simulates trips between a zone and a exact point. If no point is available within a given
	 					     zone the algorithm can default to that zone centroid (depending on origin_fallback setting).
	 					     Differs from BetweenZones because this method uses exact destinations.
 					           # COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
 					             RUN SIMULATIONS FOR EACH AND EVERY SCHOOL
	 					   ^ USED IN LIVERPOOL, YORK EXAMPLES
	  					   ~ e.g.: { 
						   	     ZoneToPoint { zones_path: path to geojson w/polygons and multipolygons 
						   					with a "name" property,
				   					   destinations_path: ,
						   			   csv_path: path to .csv with O/D matrix as "from", "to" and "count",
						   			   origin_zone_centroid_fallback: boolean determining zone centroid 
						   			     				  fallback usage
						   			 } 
			   			  	   }
	  					   
	 5. "LineStrings" 		     	   - Reads     
	 					   ^ USED IN SEATTLE EXAMPLE
	 					   ~ e.g.:

cost:  
         1. "Distance"          - Finds the most direct path connecting O/D pairs. Equivalent to ByLTS with all weights set to 1.
         			^ EDINBURGH, ENGLAND_2011, LIVERPOOL (direct), LONDON
         			~ e.g.: "Distance"
         			 
         2. "ByLTS" 	        - Multiplies distances by a factor for each LTS classification. Bigger factors imply bigger cost 
         			  penalties (mimicking lower willingness to circulate on some road segments vs other lower LTS ones). 
         			^ USED IN LIVERPOOL (quiet), SEATTLE
         			~ e.g.: {
         				  "ByLTS": { "lts1": 1,           # cost is simply distance
         				             "lts2": 1.5,   	  # cost is 1.5 * distance
         				             "lts3": 3,		  # cost is 3 * distance
         				             "lts4": 8,	   	  # cost is 1.5 * distance
         				           }  	
         				},
         					 
         3. "Generalized"       - NOT SURE, CORRECT IF WRONG: Simulates cost according to an outer, pre-defined python script (SEE EXAMPLE FURTHER DOWN THIS GUIDE).
         			^ USED IN YORK EXAMPLE
         			~ e.g.: {
         			          "": 
         			        },
         			
         4. "OsmHighwayType"    - Multiplies distance by a factor based on the OSM highway tag. If the type is not present, it 
         			  won't be allowed at all (read more about OSM highway tags @ openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway). 
         			^ NOT USED IN ANY EXAMPLE
         			~ e.g.: { 
         				  "OsmHighwayType": { "": _,
         				        "": _,
         				      } 
         				},
         			
         5. "ExternalCommand"   - Run this command to calculate edge cost.
         			  REQUIRES ADDITIONAL PYTHON SCRIPT. (check od2net/examples/edinburgh/example_cost.py)	
         			^ USED IN YORK EXAMPLE
         			~ e.g.: {
         			 	  "ExternalCommand"
         			
uptake:  
  
[bcR-p]  1. "Identity"          -
	 			^ USED IN ENGLAND_2011, LIVERPOOL, LONDON, SEATTLE AND YORK EXAMPLES
	 			# COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
	 			  USE IDENTITY COST TO SIMULATE BASELINE SCENARIO
	 			~ e.g.:
	 			 
[bcR-p]  2. "CutOffMaxDistanceMeters" - Simulates trips whose length falls within the specified distance.
	 			        # COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
	 			          CHILDREN ARE LIMITED TO RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCES
	 			        ^ NOT USED IN ANY EXAMPLE
	 			        ~ e.g.:
	 			  
[bcR-p]  3. "GovTargetPCT"      - 
	 			# COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
	 			  RUN SIMULATIONS FOR ENMAC GOALS AND/OR CURRENT PREDICTED TRAJECTORIES
	 			^
	 			~ e.g.:
	 			  
[bcR-p]  4. "GoDutchPCT"        - Simulates according
				# COULD BE USEFUL FOR biclaR-playgrounds
